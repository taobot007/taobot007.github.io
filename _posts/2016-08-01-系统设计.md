## 一些预备知识

QPS：Quest Per Second
TPS: Transactions Per Second. 一个transaction有可能由多个quest组成

分析QPS有什么用：  

QPS = 100：用你的笔记本做Web服务器就好了  
QPS = 1K：用一台好一点的Web服务器差不多，需要考虑Single Point Failure，可能某个进程死锁，卡住了什么的。   
QPS = 1m：需要建设一个1000台Web服务器的集群，考虑Maintainance（某一台挂了怎么办）

QPS和Web Server/Database之间的关系：  

一台Web Server约承受量是1k的QPS（考虑到逻辑处理时间以及数据库查询的瓶颈）  
一台SQL Database约承受量是1k的QPS（如果JOIN和INDEX query比较多的话，这个值会更小）  
一台NoSQL Databse（Cassandra）的承受量是10k的QPS  
一台NoSQL Databse（Memcashed）的承受量是1M的QPS（可以算是一个缓存，在内存中走，不在磁盘走，速度快）

## 系统设计步骤：SNAKE方法

* 第一步： 描述使用场景，看要实现哪些功能： Scenario
    有哪些feature？有interface还是只有一个API server？Read-heavy or Write-heavy? Security?

* 第二步： 让系统运行起来的必要硬件条件： Necessary
    DAU？ QPS？

* 第三步： 应用/算法： Applicaton
    1， 画出major components，可以是分功能，可以是分层等。
    2， 找出可能出现的bottleneck，即最有可能出问题的地方。针对这些地方，设计时需小心。

* 第四步： 数据： Kilobit
    针对不同的component，选择最佳的存储方式

* 第五步： 进化： Evolve
    怎样来scale？怎样保证high availability？

## 考察系统设计的目的

The idea of these questions is to have a discussion about the problem at hand. What’s important for the interviewer is the process, which you use to tackle the problem. The typical outcome of such a discussion is a high-level architecture addressing the goals and constraints in the question. Perhaps the interviewer will choose one or more areas where they will want to discuss bottlenecks and other common problems.

Remember that there is no one right answer. A system can be built in different ways. The important thing is to be able to justify your ideas. This is somewhat different from the algorithm design questions that we looked at in a previous chapter.

Finally, keep in mind that the discussion about the same system design problem could go in different directions depending on the goals of the interviewer. They may be willing to see how you create a high-level architecture covering all aspects of the system. Or rather, they could be more interested in looking at a few specific areas and diving deeper into them. In any case, you should have a strategy for how to approach the different situations. We will look into such strategies in the next sections.

## 我们的策略

Similar to the algorithmic questions, we believe that system design questions require a combination of the right strategy and knowledge. By strategy we mean a way to approach the problem at an interview. We've seen good candidates fail not because they lack the knowledge but because they cannot focus on the right things while discussing a problem.

Because of that, in the next few sections, we will present our strategy for approaching system design questions at tech interviews. In addition to that, we've collected useful online resources, which will help you update your knowledge of software systems design.

Step1: Constraints and Use cases
      * Clarify use cases
      * Find Traffic and Amount of data

Step2: Abstract Design
      * Application service layer (serves the requests)
      * Data Storage layer

Step3: Understanding the bottleneck
      * 一般有两种情况: a lot of users? a lot of data?
      * Traffic? Storage? Security? ...

Step4: Scale up

## Scalability

* VPS（Virtual Private Server 虚拟专用服务器）技术，将一台服务器分割成多个虚拟专享服务器的优质服务。

* Vertical Scaling: improve CPU, RAM ...

* Horizontal Scaling: add more servers

* Load balancing: round robin, session sticky,

* Scalability 的实践原则:

    * 1 Every server contains exactly the same codebase and does not store any user-related data, like sessions or profile pictures, on local disc or memory. Sessions need to be stored in a centralized data store which is accessible to all your application servers. It can be an external database or an external persistent cache, like Redis.

    * 2 You can stay with MySQL, and use it like a NoSQL database, or you can switch to a better and easier to scale NoSQL database like MongoDB or CouchDB. Joins will now need to be done in your application code. The sooner you do this step the less code you will have to change in the future.

    * 3 Your users still have to suffer slow page requests when a lot of data is fetched from the database. The solution is the implementation of a cache. With “cache” I always mean in-memory caches like Memcached or Redis. Please never do file-based caching, it makes cloning and auto-scaling of your servers just a pain.

    * 4 Use asynchronism. One way is to turn dynamic content into static content.  Pages of a website, maybe built with a massive framework or CMS, are pre-rendered and locally stored as static HTML files on every change. Often these computing tasks are done on a regular basis, maybe by a script which is called every hour by a cronjob. The other more important way is  to handle tasks asynchronously. Sends a job onto a job queue and immediately signals back to the user: your job is in work, please continue to the browse the page.
