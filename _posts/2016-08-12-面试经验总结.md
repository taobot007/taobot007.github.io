### Rule of thumb

Clean the ambigurity, through:

1. ask for input and output

2. given an example

3. think about corner cases




### A bad example

What the candidate did well:

* asked about input/output

* asked about time requirement

* asked about singly/doubly linkedlist

* code style is good

What the candidate did not do well:

* did not ask the defination of "reverse"

* did not ask if there's a cycle

* did not use any example before start

* did not explain his approach

* code contains bug

* spent too much time
