### 1 Explicit Join and Implicit Join
  * Explicit Join:
  ```
  SELECT CourseName, TeacherName
  FROM Courses INNER JOIN Teachers
  ON Courses.TeacherID = Teachers.TeacherID
  ```
  * Implicit Join:
  ```
  SELECT CourseName, TeacherName
  FROM Courses, Teachers
  WHERE Courses.TeacherID = Teachers.TeacherID
  ```
  两者等价

### 2 counnt on groupby
  ```
  / * Incorrect Code */
  SELECT Students.StudentName, count( * )
  FROM Students INNER JOIN StudentCourses
  ON Students.StudentID = StudentCourses.StudentID
  GROUP BY Students.StudentID
  ```
  上边的写法,不对的地方在于:
  1. 对于没有选课的学生来说,他们没有被统计;
  2. 即使使用LEFT JOIN,对于没有选课的同学来说,他们的count会是1, 而这是不对的;
  3. GROUP BY 的是StudentID,但是不同的ID可能有多个StudentName,而这种写法并没有考虑这一点.

  那么准确的写法呢?
  ```
  / * Solution 1: Wrap with another query * /
  SELECT StudentName, Students.StudentID, Cnt
  FROM (
    SELECT Students.StudentID, count(StudentCourses.CourseID) as [Cnt]
    FROM Students LEFT JOIN StudentCourses
    ON Students.StudentID = StudentCourses.StudentID
    GROUP BY Students.StudentID
  ) T INNER JOIN Students on T.studentID =Students.StudentID
  ```
  这种写法,先是LEFT JOIN ON StudentID,并count的是CourseID,使得一个StudentID对应于准确的course count.其次是使用 INNNER JOIN 把 StudentID 映射到了 StudentName上边.

  还可以使用GROUP BY 两个column来实现:
  ```
  /* Solution 2: Add StudentName to GROUP BY clause. */
  SELECT StudentName, Students.StudentID, count(StudentCourses.CourseID) as [Cnt]
  FROM Students LEFT JOIN StudentCourses
  ON Students.StudentID = StudentCourses.StudentID
  GROUP BY Students.StudentID, Students.StudentName
  ```

### 3 Basic Operations

  ```
  SELECT * FROM table;
  SELECT DISTINCT * FROM table;
  SELECT c1, c2 FROM table WHERE;
  SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
  SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY column;
  /* NULL value in a field */
  SELECT * FROM table WHERE column IS NULL;
  /* AS: assign a temporary name to a table or column */
  SELECT c1 AS c2 FROM table;
  SELECT c1 FROM table AS t1;
  /* GROUP BY */
  SELECT column_name1, COUNT(column_name2) FROM table_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column_name1 ORDER BY COUNT(column_name2) DESC;
  /* HAVING: this clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions */
  SELECT COUNT(column_name1), column_name2 FROM table GROUP BY column_name2 HAVING COUNT(column_name1) > 5;
  /* INSERT INTO */
  INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);
  /* UPDATE and SET */
  UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
  /* DELETE */
  DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
  /* JOIN ON */
  SELECT table1.column_name1, table2.column_name2, table3.column_name3 FROM ((table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON relationship) INNER JOIN table3 ON relationship);
